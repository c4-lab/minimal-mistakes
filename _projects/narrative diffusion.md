#Project Overview
Humans are significantly influenced by the narratives that spread through their social circles and media consumption. In this research, we investigate the diffusion of narratives across a dual-layered network model, comprising both social and narrative networks. Our primary goal is to develop a mathematical model that predicts the adoption of narratives based on the strategic revelation of story elements. A secondary objective is to empirically validate this model using virality metrics derived from real-world narratives.

#Research Question
Central to this research is the question: What is the optimal strategy for revealing story elements to maximize narrative adoption? Each individual’s position within the social network can significantly affect the dissemination of story elements, while the narrative network’s topology influences the interconnectivity and influence of these elements. From a practical standpoint, the research can offer strategies for counteracting misinformation or enhancing marketing campaigns.
