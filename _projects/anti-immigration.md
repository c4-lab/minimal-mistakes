Human's are neurologically wired to experience the emotions of others. Empathy is important for harmoniuous social interactions, and the loss of empathy has been found to correlate with intergroup conflict and dehumanization of outgroups. Numerous studies have investigated the role loss of empathy online might play in the emergence of toxicity and tribalism.

Current neuroscience suggest at least two major pathways for empathy in humans. One of these is emotional, wherein we respond to one another's expressed emotions directly, and the other is cognitive, wherein we can experience the emotional state of others through deliberate thought and perspective taking. Visual information about others, such as facial expressions and body language, is especially important in activating the emotional pathway.

In this project, we explore the hypothsis that the dampened emotional response enables the *loss* of empathy to spread in social networks like a contagion, and that this precedes the emergence of antiimmigrant sentiment online. Initially, we are using data from Twitter to the hypothesis that empathy loss can spread.  We intend to follow these studies with controlled experiments to develop interventions, followed by design studies in the wild.
