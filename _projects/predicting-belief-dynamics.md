Building upon the “Belief Landscape Framework”, this project aims to understand individuals' beliefs on social media. Through rigorous data-driven approaches, we intend to explore the dynamics of belief formation, evolution, and the impact of various external and internal factors across different domains. We hope to use the insights gained from this research to promote positive interactions and conversations across various belief communities.
