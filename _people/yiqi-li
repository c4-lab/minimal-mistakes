I am a computational social science scholar working in information science, social networks, and organizational communication discipline areas. My research examines the information dynamics of online communities consisting of various entities such as organizations, individuals, groups, and categories, as well as strategies for effective information sharing, communication, and community organizing. Specifically, my research captures the complex interdependencies of online communities by considering their network evolution and multidimensionality.
